1. Problem Statement
Make Good Array

You are given an array of size n. You need to find the minimum number of elements you need to remove from the array so that the array becomes good. An array is said to be good if it follows the following conditions:

if the length of the array is divisible by 6.
it is possible to split it into k/6 subsequences 1,2,3,4,5,6.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer n, the size of the array.
Each of the next n lines contains an integer arr[i].
Constraints

1<=n<=105
arr[i] belongs to {1,2,3,4,5,6}
Output Format

Return the minimum number of numbers as asked in the problem.

Explanation

You can remove 3 elements, and then the array will become good.

2. Problem Statement

Abhinav, was studying about Quatro Divisors. These are numbers that have exactly 4 divisors. Now he has been given homework, based on that. His teacher wants him to find the sum of divisors of all integers in the array that have exactly 4 divisors.

If there are no such numbers than return 0.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, denoting the number of integers to be operated upon.
The subsequent lines are the integers of the array.
Constraints

The size of the array : N : 1<=N<=104 .
The array elements : 1<=arr[i]<=105 .
Output Format

The output is an integer, denoting the sum of all the divisors of all the Quatro Numbers.
Evaluation Parameters

Sample Input
3
21
4
7
Sample Output
32
Explanation
21 has 4 divisors : 1,3,7,21

4 has 3 divisors : 1,2,4

7 has 2 divisors : 1,7

Hence the answer is 1+3+7+21 = 32

3. Problem Statement

Marc and Rex are Competitive Programmers who thought of playing a game with the binary string 's', which was given to them by their teacher as homework. In turn, each person can do the following:

They can select any segment of zeroes and they will get the number of divisors of the length of that segment added to their score.
Each segment can be used only once and a segment cannot be used in parts, the segment should be used completely.
If both have the same score then Rex will be a winner.
The first chance goes to Marc.
Return "MARC" if he wins i.e. a score of Marc is greater than the score of Rex, otherwise, return "REX".

Input Format

The first and only line contains a string s.
Constraints

1<=|s|<=104
Output Format

Return the string as asked in the problem.
Sample Input

10000001001
Sample Output

MARC
Explanation

Length of segments of zeros = {6,2}

Now, replace them with their factors = {4,2}

Sort them = {2,4}

Score of Marc=4, score of Rex=2

Winner = MARC
