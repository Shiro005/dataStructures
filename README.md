_Tips for Success_

***Daily Practice: Spend at least 4-6 hours daily on learning and practicing.
Use Online Resources: Platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank for practice problems***

Join Study Groups: Collaborate with peers to discuss problems and solutions.
Mock Interviews: Utilize platforms like Pramp or interviewing.io for realistic interview practice.
Stay Consistent: Maintain a consistent study schedule and take short breaks to avoid burnout.
